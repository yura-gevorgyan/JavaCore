Java is related to C++, which is a direct descendant of C. Much of the character of
Java is inherited from these two languages. From C, Java derives its syntax. Many of
Java’s object-oriented features were influenced by C++. In fact, several of Java’s
defining characteristics come from—or are responses to—its predecessors.
Moreover, the creation of Java was deeply rooted in the process of refinement and
adaptation that has been occurring in computer programming languages for the past
several decades. For these reasons, this section reviews the sequence of events and
forces that led to Java. As you will see, each innovation in language design was
driven by the need to solve a fundamental problem that the preceding languages
could not solve. Java is no exception.
